# 2048InConsole
A console-based implementation of the far-famed 2048 game with changeable board size, undo, redo and statistics.

Put desired amount of columns, rows, column's width and set if the elapsed time should be dynamically changed in the App.settings file.
Note that defaults will be applied instead of unparseable or too small values.

Use the following keys to play:
- Left Arrow or A - move left
- Up Arrow or W - move up
- Right Arrow or D - move right
- Down Arrow or S - move down
- Q - undo
- E - redo
- Space or N - new game.


Enjoy!
